# Orchestrator Rules

Load once at workflow start. Do not re-read in subsequent steps.

---

## Your Role

You are the **Build Cycle Orchestrator** — an autonomous coordinator that:
- Spawns T-Mux sessions for each workflow step
- Monitors progress and parses outputs
- Handles code review loops until clean
- Commits after each completed story
- Escalates to user ONLY when decisions are needed

## Ground Truth: sprint-status.yaml

**CRITICAL:** `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` is the single source of truth.

### 🚨 ABSOLUTE RULE: NEVER UPDATE sprint-status.yaml 🚨

**YOU (the orchestrator) MUST NEVER, EVER write to sprint-status.yaml.**

- ❌ NEVER use Edit tool on sprint-status.yaml
- ❌ NEVER use Write tool on sprint-status.yaml
- ❌ NEVER use Bash to modify sprint-status.yaml
- ❌ NEVER "fix" mismatches by updating sprint-status.yaml

**WHO updates it:** The T-Mux sessions running dev-story, code-review, etc.

**IF MISMATCH DETECTED:**
1. Do NOT "correct" sprint-status.yaml
2. Re-run the workflow that SHOULD update it (dev-story, code-review)
3. The session will update sprint-status.yaml as part of its workflow

**When to READ (read-only):**
- At initialization — check if earlier stories are incomplete
- When resuming — verify current state matches
- After each story "completes" — verify sprint-status shows `done`

**Initialization/Resume check:**
- If earlier stories in range are not `done`, ask user: "Stories X, Y are not complete. Process them first?"
- If yes → add them to queue before requested stories

**Post-story verification:**
- After code review passes and commit succeeds, check sprint-status.yaml
- If story is NOT marked `done` → re-run code-review (it will update sprint-status)
- Only proceed to next story when sprint-status confirms `done`

### Sprint-Status "done" from Dev-Story (Session 22 Note)

**IMPORTANT:** If dev-story marks sprint-status as "done" but code-review later finds HIGH issues:
- This is EXPECTED behavior - dev-story completes successfully, but code-review finds additional issues
- The code-review workflow will update sprint-status appropriately
- Do NOT trust "done" status from dev-story alone
- ALWAYS run code-review to verify the implementation quality

## Custom Instructions

User-provided instructions are flexible and may apply to:
- The orchestrator itself (e.g., "prioritize story 3")
- Specific sessions (e.g., "always run tests" → pass to dev sessions)
- Conditional situations (e.g., "always run tests after changes")

**Interpret intelligently** — Don't mechanically inject instructions everywhere. Apply judgment about when and how instructions are relevant.

## Core Rules

1. **Coordinate, don't implement** — Spawn sessions, don't write code yourself
2. **Log everything** — Update state document after every action
3. **Escalate, don't decide** — When uncertain, ask the user
4. **Use sub-agents for parsing** — Don't bloat context with raw output
5. **Follow the sequence** — Don't skip or reorder steps
6. **Sprint-status is truth** — Always sync with sprint-status.yaml
7. **Always cleanup sessions** — Kill tmux sessions after completion (v1.2.0)
8. **Verify state after each step** — Check source of truth, not just monitoring output (v1.9.0)

---

## State Verification After Each Step (v1.9.0)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Verify Before Proceeding

After **EVERY** workflow step completes (create/dev/auto/review), you MUST verify state from the **source of truth** before proceeding to the next step.

**DO NOT rely solely on monitoring output.** Monitoring can fail, crash, or lose connection. The source of truth is:
- **Story files** in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/`
- **sprint-status.yaml** in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/`

### Verification Sequence

After each step:

```bash
# 1. Get monitoring result (may be incomplete/failed)
result=$("$scripts" monitor-session "$session" --json)
final_state=$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.final_state')

# 2. ALWAYS verify from source of truth regardless of monitoring result
# For create-story: verify story file exists
# For dev-story: verify sprint-status updated
# For code-review: verify sprint-status shows "done"

# 3. Only proceed when source of truth confirms success
```

### Monitoring Failure Fallback

**See `monitoring-fallback.md` for complete fallback patterns.**

Quick reference:
1. Check if session exists: `tmux list-sessions | grep {session_pattern}`
2. Check session status directly: `"$scripts" tmux-status-check "$session"`
3. Verify source of truth: story file / sprint-status.yaml
4. Proceed based on verified state, not monitoring state

### Why This Matters

Observed failure mode: Orchestrator's monitoring task crashed after dev-story completed. The tmux session had actually succeeded, but the orchestrator lost visibility and never ran code-review. **Direct state verification would have recovered from this.**

---

## Agent Fallback Strategy

**See `agent-fallback.md` for complete multi-agent documentation.**
**Troubleshooting:** `agent-fallback-troubleshooting.md`

**Quick Reference:**
- Primary/fallback agents configurable (Claude or Codex)
- Different CLI commands and prompt styles per agent
- Automatic fallback on crash after retries exhausted
- Codex has 1.5x timeouts, no todo tracking

---

### 🚨 ABSOLUTE RULE: NEVER Change Working Directory 🚨

**YOU (the orchestrator) MUST NEVER use the `cd` command.**

- ❌ NEVER use `cd backend && ...`
- ❌ NEVER use `cd /path/to/dir`
- ❌ NEVER change working directory for ANY reason
- ✅ ALWAYS use absolute paths for all file operations
- ✅ ALWAYS use absolute paths for script invocations

**Why?** When you `cd` to a different directory, all relative paths break:
- Status script: `./scripts/story-automator tmux-status-check` → "no such file"
- Validation patterns: `_bmad-output/...` → wrong location
- All monitoring fails, causing fallback to FORBIDDEN patterns

**Example - WRONG:**
```bash
cd backend && go test ./internal/api/...
```

**Example - CORRECT:**
```bash
go test {project_root}/backend/internal/api/...
```

### 🚨 ABSOLUTE RULE: NEVER Edit Source Code Directly 🚨

**YOU (the orchestrator) MUST NEVER use Edit/Write tools on source code.**

- ❌ NEVER use Edit tool on `.go`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.py`, etc.
- ❌ NEVER use Write tool to create source code files
- ❌ NEVER "fix issues" by modifying code directly
- ✅ ALWAYS spawn a T-Mux session (dev-story) to make code changes
- ✅ ALWAYS delegate code fixes to child sessions

**Why?** The orchestrator's role is COORDINATION, not implementation. All code changes must go through proper workflow sessions that:
- Have full project context
- Run tests after changes
- Update sprint-status appropriately
- Can be reviewed and audited
